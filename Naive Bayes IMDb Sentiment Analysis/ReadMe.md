# IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of IMDb movie reviews using a Naive Bayes algorithm. It utilizes the scikit-learn library for natural language processing and classification. The dataset used for training and testing contains movie reviews labeled with their corresponding sentiment.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Isaac-Zimba-J/Machine-Learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory containing the IMDb sentiment analysis project
   ```
   cd Machine-Learning/IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

5. Download the IMDb dataset and place it in the project directory.

6. Run the `naive_bayes_imdb.py` script to train and test the Naive Bayes model.

## Dataset
The IMDb dataset used in this project is not included in the repository due to its size. You can download it from [IMDb Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) on Kaggle. Ensure you place the CSV file in the project directory and specify the correct path in the code.

## Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including:

- Conversion of sentiment labels to binary (0 for negative, 1 for positive).
- Removal of punctuation and lowercase conversion for text data.
- Tokenization using scikit-learn's CountVectorizer.

## Model
A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is used for sentiment prediction. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and tested on the remaining data.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and a classification report, which provides precision, recall, and F1-score for both positive and negative sentiments.

## How to Improve
Here are some suggestions to enhance this project:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameter settings for the Naive Bayes model to optimize its performance.

2. **Text Preprocessing**: Explore advanced text preprocessing techniques like stemming, lemmatization, or using pre-trained word embeddings to capture more semantic information.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Experiment with different feature extraction methods, such as TF-IDF, to see if they improve model accuracy.

4. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to better understand the data distribution, feature importance, and model performance.

5. **Ensemble Methods**: Consider using ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to improve predictive performance.
